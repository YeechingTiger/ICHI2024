                <h2>Doctoral Consortium</h2>
                <p>
                    The 2023 Doctoral Consortium invites doctoral students to submit abstracts on solving problems in
                    healthcare, public health, and everyday wellness through the application of computer science,
                    information science, information technology, and communication technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Doctoral Consortium offers an outstanding opportunity for doctoral students working on health informatics problems to discuss their work in progress and receive feedback and guidance from Consortium mentors.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    All doctoral students whose extended abstract is accepted will be scheduled for a rapid-fire talk where each participant has 10 minutes, with auto-advancing slides, to present a synopsis of their work and 5 minutes for Q&As. These rapid overviews will be followed by a poster session where participants and mentors can discuss research in greater detail. Selected participants may also be invited to give a longer oral presentation. The Doctoral Consortium will close with a panel or round-table discussion on topics relevant to doctoral students, such as dissertation development, job searching, or grant seeking.
