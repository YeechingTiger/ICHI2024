                <h2>Tracks</h2>
                <p>
                    ICHI 2023 serves as a venue for the discussion of innovative technologies and implementation science, highlighting end-to-end applications, systems, and technologies, even if available only in prototype form. We strongly encourage authors to submit their original contributions describing their algorithmic, methodological or empirical contributions, and theories relevant to the broader context of health informatics. Submissions can focus on one or more specific aspects of theory, design, development, evaluation, or deployment.
                </p>


                <h4>Analytics Track</h4>
                <p>
                    In the Analytics track, we invite submission on novel methods for exploring and analyzing healthcare data such as biomedical pattern recognition, biomarker discovery, disease profiling and personalized treatment, natural language processing and text mining, recommender systems, clinical phenotyping, visual analytics, explainability, and epidemiological modeling. Submissions may also report studies on data quality assurance, data cleaning, pre-processing, and ensuring quality and integrity of healthcare data. As large amounts of data become available in healthcare, we anticipate research submissions that address big data related topics (e.g. distribution and parallelization of data analytics in healthcare, large scale textual and graph data analytics, optimization of data analytics techniques, and novel statistical approaches to big data analytics in healthcare). Additionally, we encourage submission on privacy and security in sharing healthcare data as well as evaluation and validation of methods in healthcare data analytics.
                </p>
                
                <h4>
                    Human Factors Track
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Contributions in the realm of Human Factors might include empirical studies of health-related information use and needs, socio-technical studies on the implementation and use of health information technology, studies on health informatics in the context of community impact and implications, descriptions of innovative user-centered design solutions, and studies of public policy on leveraging health informatics infrastructures. Submissions might report studies of user requirements, user-centered designs, or evaluations for use by professionals or members of the public, in hospitals, other care environments, or in the community (e.g. peopleâ€™s homes). A broad range of interactive health technologies are of interest, including the human factors of information technology for healthcare delivery and management; interactive visualizations of health data; user interactions with decision-support systems; human factors for electronic health records and other types of clinical applications; interaction design for wearable and ubiquitous health technologies; and the interaction design of novel multimodal health devices.
                </p>
            
                <h4>
                    Systems Track
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The Systems track welcomes submissions related to the design, development, deployment, and evaluation of high-performing privacy-preserving and secure software or hardware systems. The goals of these systems can be for improving healthcare efficiency, data quality, patient safety, infrastructure sustainability, care continuity, and cost containment outcomes. The Systems track also welcomes submissions on studies of consumer-facing applications that educate, engage, and empower patients or the general public to promote health and wellbeing; public health and population health informatics applications that monitor and control disease epidemic and address health issues at the population level; global health informatics research that focuses on disseminating innovations to developing economies; and research informatics innovations that enable or facilitate the conduct of basic science and clinical and translational research, especially in patient care settings towards learning health systems. Studies involving rigorous evaluation components are particularly encouraged, as well as studies describing innovative designs to address deficiencies or known unintended adverse consequences, such as disrupted workflow, diminished efficiency, decreased documentation quality, and escalated patient safety risks.

                    The conference will accept both regular and short papers.

                    Regular papers (10 pages, up to 2 pages extra with no extra charge) will describe mature ideas, where a substantial amount of implementation, experimentation, or data collection and analysis has been completed.
                    <br>
                    Short papers (6 pages, up to 1 page extra with no extra charge) will describe innovative ideas, where preliminary implementation and validation work have been conducted.

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    When submitting papers, the authors must select a track that is most appropriate for their submission. For example, a paper on information systems for healthcare delivery can be submitted to either the Systems track, or the Human Factors track, depending on the focus of the work. Before a submission is sent to the reviewers, the program chairs will also perform an assessment to determine the best fit for the submission.
                    <br>
                    Paper submissions must adhere to the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank">IEEE Proceedings Format</a> .
                    <br>
                    For publication opportunities as posters, demos, or in the industry track, for workshops, tutorials, and the doctoral consortium see the respective other calls.
